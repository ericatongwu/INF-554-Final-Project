# INF 554 Assignment for 5

## Slide1 Cover Slide
* Welcome to Burger Tour
* Our group name is Jings', as there are two people in our team with first name Jing
* The rest is called Tong

## Slide2 Why Project
* We noticed that many people around us eat lots of burgers
* Burgers are delicious, but can be unhealthy sometimes
* So we launch this project to visualize all facts about burgers

## Slide3 Target Audience
* Our target audiences are those who like to eat burgers
* Primarily students/teenagers and those who have obesity
* If you plan to have a burger, you can also check our website for a health consultancy

## Slide4 How We Convey Our Idea
* Since our project targets young people, we want to make our website more cool by using bright color and some fun elements
* You'll be able to use draggable elements to DIY your own burger
* We'll offer customized diet advice and burger fact according to your burger

## Slide5 Design Consideration
* Demonstration of visual forms to attract people's attention and improve user's 
* Light colors and flat design will be used to keep the interface neat
* Multiple visual forms will be used to convey information as people prefer to use different types of media such as music, video, and words
* The dates indicate that we have to focus on the trend rather than the outdated features

## Slide6 Phone & PC Design
* Phone website needs interaction with the user by hand clicking while the PC interacts with mouses
* Phone website would be a menu-based design while PC is based on dragging, adapting to the different sizes of the screens
* Phone website is presented vertically while PC website should be horizontally displayed

## Slide7 Demo
* Our demo consists of three parts in a logical order
    - Burger Kitchen: DIY your own burger
    - Burger Health Center: Evaluate your burger and provide health suggestions
    - Burger Museum: Fun facts about burgers

## Demo Part1/Burger Kitchen
* The draft of our first part of infographics "Burger Kitchen"
* We use draggable icons for users to choose their favorite bun, protein, and vegetables
* After dragging, the raw product will become sliced food
* The whole picture of the burger is shown real time

## Demo Part2/Burger Health Center
* By entering your age and your weight/height, we'll calculate how much nutrition will be needed each day for you
* We'll offer some food advice to make up your missing nutrition according to your DIY burger
* Some exercise suggestions will also be provided

## Demo Part3/Burger Museum
Fun facts you need to know about burgers are demonstrated in the forms of various infographics, e.g. 
  - Meat from more than 1,000 cows can go into a single burger patty
  - Americans eat 14 billion burgers every year

## Slide11-12 Improvement
Compared to the designs of other burger builder websites:
* User experience(including User Interface, Information Architecture) is better, e.g.
    - All ingredients can be chosen in the form of dragging when making your own burger in Burger Kitchen
    - Three parts(Burger Kitchen, Burger Health Center and Burger Museum) are arranged in a good logic structure
* Combined with the aspect of health and safety
    - As mentioned before, personalized exercise and nutrition tips are offered

## Slide13 Data
* Data: Burger Nutrition Dataset, etc.
* Data Source: obtain datasets from open data of several burger brands as well as the data platforms(e.g. Data world, Kaggle)

## Slide14 Timeline
1. Acquire and process data: choose proper datasets according to our topic and prepare the data for the data visualization later on
2. Design sketches: draw the sketches for each part and discuss the detailed contents
3. Refine design: be critical to the design and censor all the elements carefully
4. Deployed UI: complete the user interface and revise them according to the unified design format
5. Conclude the project: produce a working demo, make a video, write the paper and finally complete the presentation

## Slide15 Pros
* Familiarity: the topic——Burger is quite familiar to almost everyone
* Availability: datasets are available online with trustful references
* Efficiency: all the team members had related visualization project experience
