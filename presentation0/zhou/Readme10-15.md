## Part3 Burger Museum
Fun facts you need to know about burgers are demonstrated in the forms of various infographics, e.g. 
  - Meat from more than 1,000 cows can go into a single burger patty
  - Americans eat 14 billion burgers every year

## Slide 11-12 Improvement
Compared to the designs of other burger builder websites:
* User experience(including User Interface, Information Architecture) is better, e.g.
	- All ingredients can be chosen in the form of dragging when making your own burger in Burger Kitchen
	- Three parts(Burger Kitchen, Burger Health Center and Burger Museum) are arranged in a good logic structure
* Combined with the aspect of health and safety
	- As mentioned before, a personalized exercise and nutrition tips are offered
